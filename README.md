Documentation for the use of elastic stack

In this repository you will find tutorials to install ELK stack on Windows or Linux. You will also find a more detailed documentation of Elasticsearch.
I used Elasticsearch for a treatment of log files, so you will find elements about log treatment and grok. But after that, I used Elasticsearch alone, as a service in an Angular app to store and search data. You will find the code of this example.
